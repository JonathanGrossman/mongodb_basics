# MondoDB with NodeJS

At this stage of the process, you should have created a MongoDB Atlas account, created a cluster within your account, and added a database to your cluster. With this setup complete, you may now start interacting with your database. 

The main ways to interact with your database are using the CRUD operations. CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete. To create is to put one or more new documents in your database. To read is to retrieve one or more documents from your database. To update is to edit one or more documents from your database. To delete is to delete one or more documents from your database. 

The syntax for the CRUD operations are fairly simple and are explained below. Despite the simplicity, a few tips and tricks will help you master these basics.

## [Create](#create)

## [Read](#read)

## [Update](#update)

## [Delete](#delete)
