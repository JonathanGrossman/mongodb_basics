# Using MongoDB in an Express Application

In the previous chapters, you learned the MongoDB basics. Although you worked with MongoDB code, you haven't yet connected that code to a server. In this chapter, you will build an express server and connect it to MongoDB. You also will write routes and work with the data from MongoDB inside your express app. 

This chapter is different than previous ones. Previous chapters were instructional and demonstrative, whereas this chapter is more of a guided building session. In this building session, you will make an Express application that connects to MongoDB. The Express application will have routes that allow you to manages users of your application. Your routes will get all users, get a single user, and add a user.

## Step 1. Connect Express to MongoDB

1. What are the steps for connecting your express app to MongoDB Atlas?

- Do you have a MongoDB connection string?
- What are you naming your database?
- What are you naming your collection?

2. How can you confirm that the connection is successful?

## Step 2. Get all users

1. Write the boilerplate for the route

- Which http method should you use?
- For whichever http method you use, how many arguments does that express method accept?
- What are the data types those arguments?
- How will you handle errors inside your route function?

2. Write your MongoDB request

- Which MongoDB method should you use to get all users?
- How do you write the line of code to use that method?
- Upon receiving a response from MongoDB, do you need to process the response before serving it to the client?
- How do you serve the response to the client?
- Do you need to install any extra packages?

## get route for one user

## post route to add user

## using response to send new request
