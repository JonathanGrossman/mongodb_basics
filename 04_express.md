# Using MongoDB in an Express Application

In the previous chapters, you learned the MongoDB basics. Although you worked with MongoDB code, you haven't yet connected that code to a server. In this chapter, you will build an express server and connect it to MongoDB. You also will write routes and work with the data from MongoDB inside your express app.
