# What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is a popular platform for storing information for web applications. It is a database program that is cross-platform, meaning you can use MongoDB with many different programming languages, like NodeJS, Python, and others. 

Unlike SQL databases where you store information in tables, MongoDB is known as NoSQL because it doesn't store information in tables. Rather, it stores information in documents. The documents are JSON-like.

Like with many databases, with MongoDB you can interact in powerful ways with information stored within. For instance, you can search, reference, compare, change  otherwise manipulate the stored information. You can do so with optimal speed and minimal processing expense.
